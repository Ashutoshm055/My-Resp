Our website's prototype is completely based on front-end technologies. 
There are only a few features that has been added.
The web-pages & their working features are listed below.
Home-page:
  Signin & Register button
  Assess button & Intermediate button
Login-page:
  Only the login feature is in work. Username=david055, Password=abc1234
  The signin page couldn't work because there are no option to host the back-end & the database of the project.
  For the same reason you can't login with any other crediential than the provided one.
Userdashboard:
  Skill tracker( First skill module)
  Enroll buttons of upskill section
Market-insight:
  This page is complete static page.
  This page requires data analysis & back-end python programming to work, which can't be implemented with our limited knowledge.
